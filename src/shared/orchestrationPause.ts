// Main's reason (the journal, format v1) and, for a pause a turn's end caused, what that turn's activity adds:
// - provider_limit: a provider's usage limit ended the turn. The journal says paused(environment_error), as for any failed
//   turn; the CLI's message is in the turn's activity. The one recorded message is Codex's (codex-cli 0.155.1,
//   evidence/real-stage-13/series-S3-S5-S6-attempt2): "You’ve hit your usage limit. … try again at Sep 28th, 2026
//   11:51 PM." No real Claude limit message has been recorded, so a Claude limit still reads as an environment error.
//   The reset is the CLI's own words, not parsed.
// - model_unsupported: the provider refused the model the CLI's own config names. The journal says
//   paused(environment_error); the recorded message is Codex's HTTP 400 (codex-cli 0.155.1, evidence/real-a-gate R1):
//   "The 'gpt-6.1-sol' model is not supported when using Codex with a ChatGPT account." The model is the CLI's words.
// - ending: the step that ended the turn (TurnResult.ending, kept as detail.endStep of its turn_finished entry).
// - reason: main's reason as it is.
